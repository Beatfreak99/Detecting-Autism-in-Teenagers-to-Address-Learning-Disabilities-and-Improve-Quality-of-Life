Identify undiagnosed autism in teenagers, which often results in learning disabilities and can degrade quality of life if untreated. Autism symptoms can go unnoticed in childhood, 
affecting social and academic development during teenage years. We developed a predictive model to detect autism traits in teenagers based on various demographic and behavioral indicators.
Early detection can lead to timely interventions, improving the quality of life and reducing the impact on learning and social engagement.
In this project we have discussed how ML can help predict Autism in teenagers and help them in positive way.
